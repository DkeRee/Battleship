      <h2><strong>Rules:</strong></h2>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong> Select a VALID number between 1 through 20 when asked to guess battleship position<strong></li>
        <li><strong> do NOT enter a word like "apple" or a number out of the 1-20 range, or the name of the number like "one" for 1, as it will not register</strong></li>
        <li><strong> Sink 5 battleships to win! (It will tell you if you have hit or missed a ship) </strong></li>
        <li><strong> Scores will be shown as 5/(number of guesses you made), meaning the less you miss while guessing, the higher your score is going to be</strong></li>
